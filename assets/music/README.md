This folder should contain background music for the site.

Add an MP3 file named `background.mp3` here (recommended: 128-192 kbps, 2-4 minutes, soft/instrumental).

If you cannot add music, the audio controller will display console warnings and continue functioning.

Suggested sources: YouTube Audio Library, Free Music Archive, Incompetech, Bensound.

Note: Make sure you have the right to use any music you add to this folder.
